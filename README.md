It can be assisted by technologies such as <i><b>Cascading Style Sheets</i></b> and scripting languages such as <i><b>JavaScript</b></i> <br>
It's a text document saved with the extension . html or . htm that contains texts and some tags written between "< >" which give the instructions needed to configure the web page<br>
